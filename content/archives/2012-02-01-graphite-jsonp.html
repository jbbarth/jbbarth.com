<h1>Graphite &amp; JSONP</h1>

<p>These days I’m discovering <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> more in depth. To be honest, I saw <a href=
"http://speakerdeck.com/u/holman/p/scaling-github?slide=63">this slide from Zach Holman</a> and immediately thought I needed the same kind of dashboard.</p>

<p>This future dashboard will be served from a different host than the one hosting Graphite. I want to load data from Graphite into the page through
Javascript. Hence standard <span class="caps">AJAX</span> calls are impossible because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same
Origin Policy</a>, yet another security rule everyone suffer and no one (at least not me :)) understand.</p>

<p>Before I declare this measure totally stupid and finally take the time to launch <em>lolsecurity.org</em>, let’s have a look at <strong><span class=
"caps">JSONP</span></strong>. The principle is well described <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">on the Wikipedia page</a>. Instead of getting
<code>{"a json": "object"}</code> through <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <span class="caps">AJAX</span>-y friends, this technique inserts a new
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the <span class="caps">DOM</span> and evaluate its content. The client waits for something like <code>callbackFunction({"a
json": "object"})</code> and the resulting <span class="caps">JSON</span> object is processed client-side with the <code>callbackFunction()</code> function.
This function name should be supplied by the client as a parameter to the <span class="caps">URL</span>, though it’s not normalized. As it doesn’t make use
of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to retrieve the content, it’s not subject to the <em>Same Origin Policy Hell ©</em>.</p>

<p>If you look at jQuery, the <code>$.ajax</code> functions galaxy allow you to use <span class="caps">JSONP</span> by setting <code>dataType: "jsonp"</code>
in the request configuration. The callback name is often passed through <code>?callback=blah</code> or <code>jsoncallback=blah</code> in the <span class=
"caps">URL</span>. For Graphite, it should be passed as <code>jsonp=blah</code> though it’s not really well documented^W^W^W^W not documented at all (it took
me nearly 2 hours to make it work, the time to be fed up enough to look at the Python source code :/). The final result looks like this :</p>

<pre>
//graphite host
var url = "http://graphite-server/render/";
//add target and everything needed by graphite URL API...
url = url + "?target=<graph-data-etc.>";
//set "json" as the response format
url = url + "&format=json";
//set "jsonp" parameter to set the callback name
//the "?" will automagically be replaced by jQuery
url = url + "&jsonp=?";
//finally go!
$.getJSON(url, function(data){
  //do whatever you want with the result
  console.log(data);
});
</pre>

<p>It should work out of the box, though a look at your favorite browser’s inspector won’t hurt.</p>

<p>Since Graphite <span class="caps">URL</span> generation can be hard, I recommend you use the <a href=
"https://github.com/prestontimmons/graphitejs">graphitejs</a> plugin if you use jQuery.</p>
