title: "My bank is crazy"

<h1>My bank is crazy</h1><p>Last week, I made the stupid choice to buy a new computer online. <em>Big mistake Bob.</em></p>
<p>I knew there were high chances I reached the payment limit of my credit card, so I asked my bank to increase it (+1500&euro;, maximum for my type of card). They told me it was ok, the new payment limit would be effective in the next 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But my bet is they didn&#8217;t do anything. I began to get payments refused in the last two days. Yesterday I tried to fuel my car at 7am before <a href="http://rulu.eu/"><span class="caps">RULU</span> 2012</a>, when everybody&#8217;s sleeping in Lyon, so I praised the machine but&#8230; <code>Payment Refused</code>. Called my bank, the guy said he&#8217;d increase the limit again and it would be ok within 10 minutes. Ok.</p>
<p>I patiently waited 10 minutes, then retried to buy gas 4 times. <code>Payment Refused</code>. No luck. What I didn&#8217;t know at this time was that, even if the payment gets refused, a 130&euro; &#8220;footprint&#8221; is each time requested to my bank, and this sum gets added to my payment limit calculation.</p>
<p>This morning I called my bank 3 times, and in the end it seems the new payment limit has only been processed yesterday evening, but it&#8217;s now reached and I can&#8217;t do anything until July 1st when the counter will hopefully get reset. My banker will try to unlock the situation tuesday, but she wasn&#8217;t very optimistic. Also, I&#8217;m still 800&euro; far from my payment limit if I only count <strong>real</strong> payments.</p>
<p>In the end, a system which is here to protect me prevents me to use <strong>my</strong> money, although I have 3000&euro;+ on my account. There are high chances I lose some online subscriptions I have, and maybe even the server I have @ Hetzner if the counter reset is late. I&#8217;m really angry now.</p>
<p>This bank system is just all fucked.</p>
