title: "CAS authentication for Redmine"

<h1>CAS authentication for Redmine</h1><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I wanted to integrate <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service"><span class="caps">CAS</span></a> server at $<span class="caps">WORK</span>. Unfortunately, Redmine only supports its integrated login/password, <span class="caps">LDAP</span> auth and OpenID. There are existing demands on this topic (<a href="http://www.redmine.org/issues/2965">#2965 for instance</a>) but Redmine developers always refused to implement such specific authentications in the core itself. I approve this choice, I think they should even drop OpenID, and maybe <span class="caps">LDAP</span> support (hard to maintain so many things, the core should be leaner).</p>
<h2>Existing solutions</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m only aware of two existing solutions if you want to authenticate your Redmine users against <span class="caps">CAS</span> :</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2009/07/22/casify-redmine/">a blog post titled &#8216;CASify Redmine&#8217;</a> : it explains how to <em>modify</em> the core to use rubycas-client, definitely not a long-term solution</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_cas">a plugin called redmine_cas</a> : it works, but it doesn&#8217;t exactly fit my needs :
	<ul>
		<li>it replaces Redmine standard authentication <em>completely</em> : I just want <span class="caps">CAS</span> authentication as a comfort option, as some of my users are not registered on the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server</li>
		<li>it cannot be configured in the interface : as a datacenter which offers a SaaS product for dozens of users, I want them to be able to configure the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server themselves (we have multiple addresses depending on wether your users are on the intranet, extranet or internet)</li>
		<li>there&#8217;s an annoying but when clicking on &#8220;logout&#8221; : <code>undefined method `destroy' for {}:Hash</code>, though it may be easy to fix</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, I also wanted to try to the OmniAuth authentication framework and see if it could help integrating Redmine with external authentication sources (not only <span class="caps">CAS</span>).</p>
<h2>OmniAuth</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a> (<a href="http://intridea.com/2010/10/4/omniauth-flexible-authentication-for-rack?blog=company">blog post</a>) is an awesome authentication framework built as a Rack middleware.</p>
<p>It has a pretty simple workflow for external authentication sources. If we take the example of <span class="caps">CAS</span> :</p>
<ul>
	<li>call <code>/auth/cas</code> and you will be redirected to the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server (with the needed back url)</li>
	<li>after you logged in to your <span class="caps">CAS</span> server, you&#8217;re redirected to <code>/auth/cas/callback</code> and free to do whatever you want with the params returned, stored in <code>request.env["omniauth.auth"]</code> ; this hash stores at least the &#8220;provider&#8221; (&#8220;cas&#8221;) and the &#8220;uid&#8221; (&#8220;jeanbaptiste.barth&#8221; for instance)</li>
</ul>
<p>OmniAuth is covered in 3 railscasts, but the one that has been really helpful is <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth">#241 Simple OmniAuth</a>.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;redmine_omniauth_cas&#8221; plugin</h2>
<p>I spent some hours last week-end to build the &#8220;redmine_omniauth_cas&#8221; plugin. The code is <a href="https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_omniauth_cas">on github</a>. It relies on OmniAuth for (optionally) authenticating your users against a <span class="caps">CAS</span> server. The <span class="caps">CAS</span> server has to be configured in the plugin configuration section. It&#8217;s only compatible with Redmine 1.2.0 since latest versions of OmniAuth are not compatible with Rack 1.0.1.</p>
<p>There are currently some limitations I plan to improve in the next versions :</p>
<ul>
	<li>implement ticket validation when first opening your browser (for now you&#8217;ll be considered as logged out if your session has expired on Redmine but your ticket is still valid on the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server)</li>
	<li>add a plugin option to hide &lsquo;normal&rsquo; login/password form</li>
	<li>authorize on-the-fly registration</li>
</ul>
<p>I also plan to contribute to OmniAuth and especially the <span class="caps">CAS</span> provider. The current implementation is functional but not so flexible, since it doesn&#8217;t support OmniAuth&#8217;s mechanisms to setup the <span class="caps">CAS</span> options at runtime.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This plugin is a first try at using OmniAuth with Redmine, but I could easily imagine building plugins to authenticate against other sources. I hope it will be useful for some of you. I think it could even be a viable option to throw OpenID support out of the core, and let it live its life in a clean plugin. Stay tuned !</p>
