<h1>A first sight at Riak</h1>

<p>It’s been a long time since I wanted to test <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/"><span class="caps">RIAK</span></a>, a <em>“NoSQL”</em> (what a fucking
stupid word) database from the Basho team. It’s Dynamo-inspired, you can process data through “MapReduce” jobs on server side, and it’s content-agnostic. It
can scale easily on numerous nodes and it aims at being strongly fault tolerant, so no node is particular in a riak cluster.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard about the <span class="caps">CAP</span> theorem ? In brief, it says that <em>“In a distributed system, you can’t get a perfect
Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance at the same time”</em>. It’s like that, it’s been proved, now you’ll have to live with that. Riak focuses
on the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>P</strong> sides, which means a Riak cluster is not always perfectly Consistent (it’s not boolean, your consistency
needs can be tuned). A first node can have some data, and you might have to wait a certain amount of time before this data is coherent with the node
<em>you</em> query. Which is perfectly fine in most cases.</p>

<h2>Install Riak</h2>

<p>What’s fun with Riak is the scalability thing. If you want to test it, the wiki has a great tutorial about <a href=
"http://wiki.basho.com/Building-a-Development-Environment.html">Building a Development Environment</a>. Erlang was a bit too old on my Ubuntu 10.10 (R13B03
instead of required R13B04), so I had to get a fresh version from sources:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
sudo aptitude install build-essential libncurses5-dev openssl libssl-dev
[ -f otp_src_R13B04.tar.gz ] || wget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R13B04.tar.gz
tar zxvf otp_src_R13B04.tar.gz
cd otp_src_R13B04
./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</pre>

<p>Then I installed Riak latest stable release (0.14.1). I could have taken current master branch too, but I wanted something stable for my first steps into
:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
[ -f riak-0.14.1.tar.gz ] || curl -O http://downloads.basho.com/riak/riak-0.14/riak-0.14.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak-0.14.1.tar.gz
mv riak-0.14.1 riak
cd riak
make all
make devrel
</pre>

<p>It built me 3 nodes as expected, located in <code>./riak/dev</code> folder. So let’s start the 3 nodes and <em>cluster-ize</em> them :</p>

<pre>
% cd riak/dev
% ./dev1/bin/riak start
% ./dev2/bin/riak start
% ./dev3/bin/riak start
% ./dev2/bin/riak-admin join dev1@127.0.0.1
% ./dev3/bin/riak-admin join dev1@127.0.0.1
</pre>

<h2>Command line</h2>

<p>We have 2 binaries :</p>

<pre>
% dev1/bin/riak
Usage: riak {start|stop|restart|reboot|ping|console|attach}
% dev1/bin/riak-admin
Usage: riak-admin { join | leave | backup | restore | test | status |
                  reip | js_reload | wait-for-service | ringready |
                  transfers | remove }
</pre>

<p><code>riak-admin</code> allows us to see the parameters of a running instance through the <code>status</code> command, and especially the state of our
<code>ring</code> (= cluster of riak nodes) :</p>

<pre>
% dev1/bin/riak-admin status |grep ring_
ring_members : ['dev1@127.0.0.1','dev2@127.0.0.1','dev3@127.0.0.1']
ring_num_partitions : 64
ring_ownership : &lt;&lt;"[{'dev3@127.0.0.1',21},{'dev2@127.0.0.1',21},{'dev1@127.0.0.1',22}]"&gt;&gt;
ring_creation_size : 64
</pre>

<p>And we can see if the ring is ready to serve requests :</p>

<pre>
% dev1/bin/riak-admin ringready
TRUE All nodes agree on the ring ['dev1@127.0.0.1','dev2@127.0.0.1',
                                'dev3@127.0.0.1']
</pre>

<p>We can even test if a node is able to read/write data :</p>

<pre>
% dev1/bin/riak-admin test

=INFO REPORT==== 21-Dec-2010::18:35:06 ===
Successfully completed 1 read/write cycle to 'dev1@127.0.0.1'
</pre>

<p>NB: I didn’t manage to make this test fail, I don’t really know what it tests. Restricting read/write permissions on <code>dev*/data/</code> doesn’t seem
to affect it, but I presume Riak buffers things in memory in such cases, so it would need some more tests…</p>

<h2><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Exploration</h2>

<p>Riak has a full <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, so it’s dead simple to dialog with your ring (from any of its nodes). It
returns <span class="caps">JSON</span>, so it’s easy to parse (formatting is mine in the following examples).</p>

<p>You can organize data into <code>buckets</code>, which are containers for storing elements of the same type. You can get informations on a bucket
(existing or not) with :</p>

<pre>
% curl http://localhost:8091/riak/MyBucket
{
"props": {
  "name": "MyBucket",
  "n_val": 3,
  "allow_mult": false,
  "last_write_wins": false,
  "precommit": [],
  "postcommit": [],
  "chash_keyfun": {
    "mod": "riak_core_util",
    "fun": "chash_std_keyfun"
  },
  "linkfun": {
    "mod": "riak_kv_wm_link_walker",
    "fun": "mapreduce_linkfun"
  },
  "old_vclock": 86400,
  "young_vclock": 20,
  "big_vclock": 50,
  "small_vclock": 10,
  "r": "quorum",
  "w": "quorum",
  "dw": "quorum",
  "rw": "quorum"
}
}
</pre>

<p>If the bucket doesn’t exist, it will be created as soon as you insert an element in it.</p>

<p>You can get the list of all existing buckets with :</p>

<pre>
% curl http://localhost:8091/riak?buckets=true 
{"buckets":["articles","rekon"]}
</pre>

<p>And get some general stats on the node you query (the result is quite similar to stats on a particular bucket) :</p>

<pre>
% curl http://localhost:8091/riak/stats
{
"props": {
  "name": "stats",
  "n_val": 3,
  "allow_mult": false,
  "last_write_wins": false,
  "precommit": [],
  "postcommit": [],
  "chash_keyfun": {
    "mod": "riak_core_util",
    "fun": "chash_std_keyfun"
  },
  "linkfun": {
    "mod": "riak_kv_wm_link_walker",
    "fun": "mapreduce_linkfun"
  },
  "old_vclock": 86400,
  "young_vclock": 20,
  "big_vclock": 50,
  "small_vclock": 10,
  "r": "quorum",
  "w": "quorum",
  "dw": "quorum",
  "rw": "quorum"
}
}
</pre>

<h2>But I wanna haz some <span class="caps">GUI</span> !</h2>

<p>Not happy with the command line ? <a href="https://github.com/adamhunter">Adam Hunter</a> built <a href="https://github.com/adamhunter/rekon">Rekon</a>, a
data browser for your riak node, built as a riak app (only riak objects and javascript, yeah). Installation is pretty simple, in our case for our “dev1” node
:</p>

<pre>
curl -s get.rekonapp.com | node=127.0.0.1:8091 sh
</pre>

<p>Then navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8091/riak/rekon/go">http://localhost:8091/riak/rekon/go</a>, and <em>tadam</em> :</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/articles/riak-rekon.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I let you play with it, it’s intuitive enough.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Riak is an amazing piece of software. In future posts, I’ll try to discuss how you can query it from a Rails app with the Ripple client library, and some
other exciting things such as deployment and system administration things.</p>
