title: "Canvas or SVG"

<h1>Canvas or SVG</h1><p>The choice is not easy in this case&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">EDIT</span></strong>: just a quick note, it&#8217;s not an other <span class="caps">SVG</span> vs Canvas comparison. My &#8220;Canvas&#8221; version uses pure HTML+jQuery things so there&#8217;s a bias I&#8217;m totally aware of.</p>
<p>Recently I <a href="http://jbbarth.com/archives/2011/6/17/playing_with_canvas/">blogged about an experiment</a> I was making for building logical maps of an application architecture, e.g. servers, components, arrows to represent relations between servers, etc. It was built with HTML&#8217;s Canvas and dirty Javascript code, but I was pretty sure I would switch to CoffeeScript and <span class="caps">SVG</span> (with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaelJS</a> library).</p>
<p>After a day of work, I have started the switch to <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> and <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>. It&#8217;s not finished yet, but it&#8217;s moving fast, no problem on that side. All the code is now pure client code, I&#8217;ve migrated the few functions I had in Ruby/<span class="caps">ERB</span> to Javascript. I even started to tweak and read a Cakefile (<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/cake.html">doc</a>) to ease build actions and organize my code. I&#8217;m really impressed with CoffeeScript so far, it&#8217;s amazingly concise and has some high-level concepts to make Javascript easier. Feels good !</p>
<p>On the <span class="caps">SVG</span> side, I&#8217;m not that happy. I managed to have the basic things working :</p>
<ul>
	<li>draw boxes</li>
	<li>position boxes automatically</li>
	<li>put text in each box</li>
	<li>make boxes draggable</li>
	<li>draw links dynamically between related boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the result :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/0000/0062/canvas-svg-itmap.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>But I miss a lot of things :</p>
<ul>
	<li>collision detection ? seems I have to write my own</li>
	<li>grouping management ? same, <span class="caps">SVG</span> doesn&#8217;t support it, so I had to write some basic stuff to make pieces of text move with their box</li>
	<li>text flow ? nothing, so I have to fix height manually on boxes</li>
	<li>styling elements : <span class="caps">SVG</span> doesn&#8217;t rely on <span class="caps">CSS</span> (I can retrieve properties and translate them, but it&#8217;ll be tiresome)</li>
	<li>can&#8217;t style rectangle borders under 2px (it&#8217;s ugly)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, it comes with good things that I won&#8217;t have with Canvas :</p>
<ul>
	<li>drag/drop work on iPhone/iPad</li>
	<li>vectors : you keep high-quality rendering when zooming</li>
	<li>animations : not useful now, but maybe later</li>
	<li>everything is an object, so I won&#8217;t have to re-draw the whole map when there&#8217;s a change</li>
</ul>
<p>The repo is finally <a href="https://github.com/jbbarth/itmap">on github</a> and you can watch <a href="http://jbbarth.com/itmap/public/index.html">a live demo here</a> where both methods are displayed side by side : Canvas on the left, <span class="caps">SVG</span> on the right.</p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t really know what to do. Everything would be easier if you could embed <span class="caps">HTML</span> trees in an <span class="caps">SVG</span> element, but it&#8217;s not possible by default. I started to play with a Raphael plugin called <a href="https://github.com/kreynolds/RaphaelJS-Infobox">Infobox</a> so I keep <span class="caps">HTML</span> for representing servers. The idea would be to manage a grid and the boxes only with <span class="caps">SVG</span>, and have <span class="caps">HTML</span> embedded in it so it solves styling/flow problems. It works with some effort, but it starts to become pretty complicated, and there are still a lot of problems to solve.</p>
<p>It seems there&#8217;s no magical solution in the <span class="caps">SVG</span>/Canvas world (for now). Any suggestion would be welcome.</p>
