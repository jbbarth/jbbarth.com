<h1>How to play with Rails 3.1 on Ubuntu with RVM</h1>

<p>Rails core team recently confirmed that Rails 3.1 will ship by default with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href=
"http://sass-lang.com/"><span class="caps">SASS</span></a> and <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>. While Prototype
replacement with jQuery is not controversial, this is not the case for <span class="caps">SASS</span> (a framework to <span class="caps">DRY</span> up your
stylesheets) and CoffeeScript (a cleaner syntax on top of Javascript). Everything is explained <a href=
"http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-3-1-adopts-coffeescript-jquery-sass-and-controversy-4669.html">here</a>, and you can look at <a href=
"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9f09aeb8273177fc2d09ebdafcc76ee8eb56fe33">all the smart comments on the github commit</a>.</p>

<p>RubyInside blog also published an excellent tutorial on <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-1-coffeescript-howto-4695.html">how to play with
Rails 3.1 right now</a>. <strong>Read it first, I will not explain everything here</strong>, but I had 2 problems following the how-to.</p>

<p>First, install rails master branch (I use the awesome <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/hub">hub</a> wrapper for git) :</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
cd ~/code
git clone rails/rails
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then create a gemset with <span class="caps">RVM</span> :</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
rvm use 1.9.2@yourapp --create
gem install i18n thor bundler
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then we can create our rails app:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
./rails/bin/rails new yourapp --edge
cd yourapp
  </div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, I had 2 problems with this application.</p>

<p>First, the <code>rails</code> binary installed in $GEM_HOME/bin is not fully functional :</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
% rails -v
/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:762:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem rails (&gt;= 0) (Gem::LoadError)
      from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:219:in `activate'
      from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems.rb:1065:in `gem'
      from /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@yourapp/bin/rails:18:in `&lt;main&gt;'
  </div>
</div>

<p>The simplest way to solve this is a shell alias:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
% alias rails=$GEM_HOME/bundler/gems/rails-*/bin/rails
% rails -v
Rails 3.1.0.beta
  </div>
</div>

<p>With this, I could make the application run, with <span class="caps">SASS</span> support, good.</p>

<p>But CoffeeScript didn’t work. When I tried to introduce an <code>app/assets/javascripts/awesome.js.coffee</code> script, nothing happened, no alert. I had
the following error instead of a normal <code>application.js</code> file:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
ExecJS::RuntimeError
Could not find a JavaScript runtime
  </div>
</div>

<p>The error is thrown by the ExecJS gem. It tries to find the best javascript runtime among those listed <a href=
"https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs/blob/master/README.md">in the <span class="caps">README</span></a>. There’s at least one included in MacOS X, but as a
Ubuntu user, I have none. I tried to install <code>therubyracer</code> and <code>mustang</code>, but 1/ it took a very long time (compilation of native code
on a netbook), 2/ it led me to other errors I had not been able to understand. The simplest way I found to get a working JS runtime is the
<code>nodejs</code> package of the distribution:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
% sudo aptitude install nodejs
  </div>
</div>

<p>Restart the Rails server, and everything should work smoothly now!</p>

<p>You can forget the advices in the CoffeeScript section, the application.js is already good with <code>//= require blah</code> at the beginning.</p>

<p>One last thing, you should note this Rails version is pre-beta. Some things may not work. For instance, the scaffold generators gives you an
<code>app/assets/javascripts/&lt;controller&gt;.js.coffee</code> with 3 comment lines starting with <code>//</code> instead of <code>#</code>, resulting in
this kind of errors:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
Error: Parse error on line 1: Unexpected 'MATH'
  </div>
</div>

<p>Don’t know if it’s a Rails or ExecJS bug though. But the conclusion is the same: use with caution.</p>

<p>I’m really excited with the upcoming features in Rails 3.1, particularly automatic reloading and engines support. It was pretty fun to see all this rage
around CoffeeScript and <span class="caps">SASS</span>, both seem nice, productive, and are easy to disable. I can’t wait to try a RC version !</p>
