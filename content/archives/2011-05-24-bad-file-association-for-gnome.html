<h1>Bad file association for gnome shortcuts</h1><p>Note to myself :</p>
<p>Recently I upgraded my desktop to Ubuntu Natty at $<span class="caps">WORK</span>. Some file associations broke, ok. It wasn&#8217;t a problem til the moment I tried to open a shared samba device in gnome menu&#8217;s shortcuts, and chose the wrong binary to open that. From now, every time I tried to open a shortcut in this menu, LibreOffice was launched, argl :(</p>
<p>The place where this setting was saved has been pretty hard to find, but I finally identified it in <code>$HOME/.local/share/xfce4/helpers/custom-FileManager.desktop</code>. Just removed this file and everything&#8217;s ok now.</p>
