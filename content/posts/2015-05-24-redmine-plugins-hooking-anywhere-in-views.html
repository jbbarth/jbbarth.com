# Redmine plugins: Hooking anywhere in views

## State of the hook union

If you're a hobbyist Redmine plugin developer, chances are you already have used hooks ([documentation](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Hooks)) quite extensively. There are 2 types of hooks in Redmine, which share some common characteristics but are also fundamentally different :

- controller hooks allow you to change Redmine behaviour by executing arbitrary ruby code at some point in some action processing ;
- view hooks allow you to add some "*HTML*" in views at some pre-defined places. Actually HTML is really any ERB-friendly code you want, so you can have all the power of ERB, or any ruby processing between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> tags, with the noticeable limitation of not being able to define classes, modules, or method there.

Both are needed in plugins. Without them, the only way to change behaviour in plugins would be, respectively :

- for controller hooks : to override the whole method through monkey-patching
- for view hooks : to override the whole partial (plugin views / partials take precedence over core)

While I don't have anything against monkey-patching itself in some particular cases, it turns out it has some downsides. The following problems for controller hooks have their equivalent for view hooks:

- it can be difficult to monkey-patch (or override a view) because Redmine has a
lot of logic in controllers, and some methods are dozens lines long, and the
load order may not be straightforward ;
- it makes your code fragile when you have to upgrade the Redmine core itself on
a production instance (more on that later) ;
- it can be hazardous when multiple plugins override the same method, the
end-result is not guaranteed.

The point is, controller hooks are great and needed. But on the view side, in
most cases you will want to modify a Redmine view just a few lines before or
after the existing hook. Or maybe there won't be any hook in the file and you'll
go the "full overriding" way. Or maybe you will file an issue on
[redmine.org](https://redmine.org/), requesting a new view hook, which you'll probably never
get because it doesn't make sense (core developers are too busy fixing important
bugs and implementing nice features). And even if you did, you won't get
anything in your current, stable version.

I hope we will agree that the idea that there could be an explicit hook before
and after any HTML tag in all Redmine views is stupid. There has to be a better
way!

## A new hope

[Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) is an open-source e-commerce engine, and
it's built from scratch to be very modular and extensible. The smart guys who
develop it designed a pretty elegant solution to the view hook problem: they
built [deface](https://github.com/spree/deface), a gem that gives you the
ability to declare modifications you wish to see in your partials (technically
this is called a `Deface::Override`), and those modifications are applied when
the partial is rendered, by targetting a specific place in your ERB view while
it's being rendered with a CSS or XPath selector.

A `Deface::Override` looks like this:

    Deface::Override.new(
      :virtual_path  => "issues/new",
      :name          => "add-warning-for-beginners",
      :insert_before => "h1",
      :text          => %(<div class=warning>Beware you're submitting an issue
                          on the production instance !</div>)
    )

You need 5 things when you define a `Deface::Override` :

- a `:virtual_path` : "which partial" do you want to change ?
- a unique `:name`
- an action (here `:insert_before`) and a place to apply it (here the CSS
selector `h1`)
- a piece of `:text` you want to insert (or a `:partial` name)

The piece of code above does what you already guessed: it _inserts above_ each
_h1_ title the _text_ when rendering the _issues/new_ partial.

And it doesn't need any modification in the partial itself, pretty cool heh? It
works as long as you can reach a specific part of the partial with a CSS
selector or an XPath selector.

So how does it integrate with Redmine?

## Using deface in a Redmine plugin

The first obvious step to using deface in your Redmine plugin is to include the
gem. If you have total control over the Redmine instance (which means you accept
to include code _outside_ your plugin), you can use the `Gemfile.local` file in
the root of your instance. If you don't want to pollute your Redmine core
instance (which I advise), or if you want to be able to distribute your
plugin, you can put a `Gemfile` at the root of your plugin and Redmine will
automatically evaluate it when booting.

    gem 'deface'

There's a slight limitation to that approach: bundler does not support multiple,
contradictory definitions for the same gem, e.g. you can't have two different `Gemfile`s
requesting the same gem with different constraints. If you do so, you will get a
warning like this:

    You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements.
    You specified: deface (>= 0) and deface (= 0.9.0)

That's why I recommend not precising the version of deface in your plugin's
`Gemfile`, unless you are sure your users won't include an other plugin with a
different constraint for this gem. There is a [bundler issue](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/930)
for this but it has been closed for now as there doesn't seem to be many people
who want multiple constraints on the same gem.

So, the gem is loaded.

Now you want it to find the overrides you define. It happens that deface searchs
its overrides in `app/overrides` in the core and in potential _Rails engines_
used by the application. By default Redmine plugins are not standard Rails
engines, so you will have to manually include those paths at boot time. Put the
following lines in your plugin's `init.rb`:

    Rails.application.paths["app/overrides"] ||= []
    Rails.application.paths["app/overrides"] << File.expand_path("../app/overrides", __FILE__)

Basically this adds your plugin's `app/overrides` directory to Rails' search
paths for deface overrides, creating it first if needed. As simple as that.

Of course you will need to repeat those two steps (the `Gemfile` and the
`app/overrides` in `init.rb`) in every plugin where you want to use deface, so
that they stay independent from each other.

Well, if you want to ease this process a little bit, I created a plugin called
[redmine&#95;base&#95;deface](http://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_deface) which does
exactly that: it ensures that `deface` is properly integrated within your
Redmine instance.


## Some limitations

First, deface relies on the _nokogiri_ gem : it parses the pseudo-code generated
by ERB during the partial evaluation, and it expects it to be valid in an HTML
or XML sense. So an imaginary partial like this one wouldn't work well with
deface:

    <%= "<%=" %> "<div>" %>
        Foo!
    </div>

Actually, it's precompiled as something like this:

    <code erb-loud>"<div>"</code>
    </div>

And nokogiri cannot parse it correctly, resulting in errors when trying to
deface it. In my experience this is not the case of the majority of partials in
Redmine core, I only found this case once in `app/views/layouts/base.html.erb`
but it has been solved for a while.

Second, there may be parts of your partial you cannot reach through Nokogiri's
augmented CSS selectors or XPath selectors. But this is fairly rare and if you're
really stuck, you can always add the content elsewhere and move at load time
through Javascript.


## Conclusion

I think Deface is a really nifty idea, it makes hooking anywhere in your ERB views
really easy and the Redmine integration is pretty straightforward when you get
used to it.

Deface options are well documented in its [README on GitHub](https://github.com/spree/deface),
so we won't cover everything here and I encourage you to explore this if you want to make
your Redmine plugins even more awesome!
