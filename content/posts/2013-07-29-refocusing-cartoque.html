Refocusing Cartoque
===================

[Cartoque](http://cartoque.org) is a simple CMDB tool I wrote for the last three
years at work.


A brief history
---------------

Three years ago I took a new job in a new datacenter. There was a very simple
(and naive) PHP+Mysql tool there, written by an intern, to list servers,
applications, and the link between the two. It was pretty obvious that this
kind of information, usually grouped in a "CMDB", was crucial for the team.
Unfortunately I found no alternative in the open-source world, the only serious
one being iTop, but it presented various limitations and big UI problems. So
I started a new Ruby on Rails project, relying on the same database schema.
The schema was a bit broken, but anyway, I released a first version of the app
to production in october 2010. In 2012 I partially rewrote the whole
application with a Mongodb backend, which offered me denormalization and
allowed me to escape active_record callbacks hell.

It's now 2013 and I didn't work much on Cartoque for the past 6 months. There
are various reasons for that, the most important one being I don't have the
time to work on many projects on my free time, and I had to focus my efforts
on improving our [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) instance at work. I don't
want to abandon Cartoque at all though, so I'll try here to think about the
main mistakes I made and the points I'd like to improve in the next few
months.

Some fundamental problems / needed features
-------------------------------------------

**API first**: the main problem with the app now is loading and cleaning data,
which happens through various unflexible, hard-coded, hard-to-monitor rake
tasks. There's a small REST API but it doesn't cover much things to be honest.
Also, the API should be easy to discover and to work with (think Google App
Engine, which exposes API calls on the bottom of each page in web views).

**Say no by default**: the current application is cluttered with a lot of mess
that's 100% specific of my context at work. This is bad. Every time somebody
asks me something I should say "no" by default so that the application stays as
much generic as possible and doesn't lose itself in details.

**Flexibility**: if you want to say "no" by default, you have to make things
flexible. This was a key motivation when [introducing Mongodb](/posts/2012-02-23-trying-mongodb-for-cartoque.html),
e.g. offering custom fields as first class citizens. It didn't become a reality
for now but should be one of the next major features.

**Focused features**: focus is hard. In the current version of Cartoque there
are many sparse features, making the app bloated and hard to maintain. I need
to draw a line in the sand and focus only on features inside the line.

**~100% test coverage**: Cartoque was the first app where I tried to have a
full test suite. 100% test coverage should not be a goal per se, but being
too indulgent on yourself does not help in the long term. Today there are far
too many features that are not well tested (mostly because tests are slow and
fixtures/factories are hard). Having watched all [DAS](http://destroyallsoftware.com/)
episodes helped me to improve my testing-fu, so let's try that for real now!

**Build on strong ecosystems**: the switch to Mongodb was hard, because I had a
lot of implicit logic relying on ActiveRecord. [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org),
the ORM I chose in the end, helped a lot, and it's a fantastic piece of
software. But unfortunately that's not the case of the ecosystem as a whole.
Your stack should be working for you, not against you. The fact that some gems
I use don't put ActiveModel / Mongoid compatibility on top of their goals did
not help at all. Plus I had to fight against denormalization weirdness... I
don't really know what to do now, but Mongoid might not be the best choice for
Cartoque after all.

**Standardize design**: maintaining a whole CSS is a lot of work if you want
things to look correctly after 3 years of development. My CSS skills are poor,
so I'd better rely on a standard framework like bootstrap most of the time.
Having to clutter your design with "!important" everywhere is a sure sign you
are doing it wrong...

**Tracability**: every action in the app should be traced and auditable. That
is not the case for now, and it's very hard to know if an information has been
added manually or automatically through a script, who did enter the
information, and when (so that we know if it might be outdated or not).

**CI Expiration**: dealing with expired assets is a huge problem. The app
should let the user define an expiration date for the information he/she adds.
Say a server disappears, its data would be automatically or semi-automatically
purged within a few hours or days. Informations added manually would last
longer or never expire. It wouldn't take so much effort to deal with stale data
everywhere in the app when you have a heterogeneous platform. That would be a
big win.

**Localization**: maintaining french and english in the same application turned
out to be an enormous PITA. The application was french-only at first, but I
wanted to add english for obvious reasons when I decided to open-source it. 
Seems to be easy at first, you just have to move your localized string in some
`config/locales/*.ymlÌ€  files right ? Wrong. It just adds an substantial
amount of work when dealing with views for very little benefit. Dropped.

Conclusion
----------

There's a lot of work ahead but it's exciting ! If you're interested, even
remotely, in helping the development of Cartoque, don't hesitate to test it
and drop me a line by email or on Github directly.
