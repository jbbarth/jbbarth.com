<h1>Upgraded to Rails 3.1.rc6</h1>

<p><strong><span class="caps">EDIT</span></strong>: I confirm it’s fixed in 3.1.0-stable, and this patch is not compatible with the stable version.</p>

<p>This night I upgraded my main app of the moment to Rails 3.1.rc6. I followed <a href=
"http://davidjrice.co.uk/2011/05/25/how-to-upgrade-a-rails-application-to-version-3-1-0.html">this awesome post</a> and everything went fine. I had to fix
one or two tests, and now I have to think about what goes to the asset pipeline or not, but everything works fine!</p>

<p>One little gotcha with this version though, Sprockets outputs a lot (and I mean a <strong><span class="caps">LOT</span></strong>) of deprecation warnings
because of this: <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2598">https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2598</a></p>

<p>The interesting part of this patch can easily be backported in an initializer until 3.1-stable is released. Let’s put it in
<code>config/initializers/sprockets_warnings_silencer.rb</code> :</p>

<pre>
require 'sprockets/helpers/rails_helper'

module Helpers
  module RailsHelper
    class AssetPaths
      def digest_for(logical_path)
        if asset = asset_environment[logical_path]
          return asset.digest_path
        end

        logical_path
      end

      def rewrite_asset_path(source, dir)
        if source[0] == ?/
          source
        else
          source = digest_for(source) if performing_caching?
          source = File.join(dir, source)
          source = "/#{url}" unless source =~ /^\//
          source
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>Now let’s explore all the awesome features of Rails 3.1 ! (and first split my bloated <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript files)</p>
