Riak CS: store your files on top of Riak
========================================

Last month [Basho Tecnologies](http://basho.com), the company behind [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/),
open-sourced [Riak CS](http://basho.com/riak-cloud-storage/), the storage software they built on top of Riak.
Riak is already known for being a distributed, reliable, fault-tolerant database. I already explored a bit
Riak back in 2011 [here](/posts/2011-04-21-a-first-sight-at-riak.html) and [here](/posts/2011-04-23-basic-usage-of-riak-in.html).

Riak CS has an Amazon S3 compatible API. It's nice because there are already many tools available which
support S3 API, so there's already a bunch of client code and libraries compatible with Riak CS as a file
storage system. Note that this is not unique: that's also the case of OpenStack's Swift, EMC's Atmos,
Eucalyptus or Nimbus.io, though I don't have experience with any of them. Basho provides some comparison
points in their docs if you're interested.


Installing Riak CS
------------------

Installing Riak CS for test and development purposes is easy with [The Riak CS Fast Track](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/riakcs-tutorials/fast-track/),
especially [Building a Virtual Testing Environment](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Building-a-Virtual-Test-Environment/).
No need to repeat Basho docs here, just follow the steps they suggest. Note that sometimes Vagrant fails
just after the box download, you might want to retry the `vagrant up` command then.

_Just a quick note here: I first tried to follow the process 2 days after Basho open-sourced Riak CS. It
was a bit rough around the edges back then but the Basho team has been incredibly responsive and
helpful to get things running properly. I rarely saw such a level of care before, it's really awesome
and it just makes me want to work more with Riak/Riak CS in the future. The whole process has been made
as smooth as possible since then, but if you have a problem, I encourage you to ping them on IRC or on
the mailing list._

After the Vagrant box has been installed and provisionned successfully, you should have a running
Riak CS node (under Ubuntu 12.04) and your admin credentials in hand. Time to play!


Basic bucket/file usage
-----------------------

You can follow the [Testing the Riak CS Installation](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/tutorials/fast-track/Testing-the-Installation/)
page. I recommend installing a recent version of `s3cmd` through the tarball if you're under MacOSX.

I'll skip the `-c ~/.s3cfgfasttrack` parameter below and assume you had left the config file in
its default place like me.

You should now be able to create a new bucket:

    s3cmd mb s3://test-bucket

List buckets through ls:

    s3cmd ls

Put a file in the newly created bucket:

    s3cmd put /etc/hosts s3://test-bucket

See the file is here in the bucket:

    s3cmd ls s3://test-bucket

Get the file, optionnally providing a destination path:

    s3cmd get s3://test-bucket/hosts /tmp/hosts

And finally remove it from the bucket if you want:

    s3cmd del s3://test-bucket/hosts

Pretty standard features for a file storage service or even any "filesystem". There are plenty
of other standard features (sync a subtree, move, copy, rename, symlink, etc.). There are also
advanced features such as ACLs depending on the user, you may run `s3cmd --help` and try to
play with them yourself if you want.


Managing users
--------------

The Fast Track install we followed before comes with a handy tool to manage your Riak CS users,
"Riak CS Control". It's a simple Ember.js app that allows you to issue basic CRUD operations on
your users and change/revoke their secret key if needed.

It should be started by default on port 8000, so just point your browser to http://localhost:8000
and see what can be done by yourself!

If you need more maybe you should have a look at [Riak Control](https://github.com/basho/riak_control)
(which manages Riak, not Riak CS, and is a successor to Rekon if I'm not mistaken).


Monitoring
----------

If you want to dig into what your Riak CS cluster is doing under the hood, you might want to retrieve
[global metrics](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Monitoring-and-Metrics/). Those metrics
are exposed through the HTTP interface but they require authentication.

I don't have much experience with that, Authentication doesn't seem easy to achieve in a web browser
or with curl directly. More explanations [here](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Authentication/).

The [s3curl tool](http://aws.amazon.com/code/128) will help you sign your requests automatically
depending on your secret key. You can download it and move the perl script to `/usr/local/bin/s3curl`
so that it will be easy to use. You'll also have to configure `~/.s3curl`, in my case:

    %awsSecretAccessKeys = (
      personal => {
        id => 'HQ2BG22_AEZSYZNEKJSC',
        key => 'GxDAOaze_ec7IazUg7Hw73ZcL8QLmgmf0Pws3w==',
      },
    );

Just to test it works, you can upload a file with `s3cmd` and then test you retrieve it with `s3curl`:

    s3cmd put /etc/hosts s3://test-bucket

Then:

    http_proxy=localhost:8080 s3curl --id personal -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/test-bucket/hosts
    #=> should display your /etc/hosts file

If that doesn't work, the `--debug`flag can be useful to see the request/response cycle and understand
what happens.

Now that you've a working s3curl config, you can retrieve some statistics:

    http_proxy=localhost:8080 s3curl --id personal -- -s http://s3.amazonaws.com/riak-cs/stats | python -mjson.tool

I used the `-s` option to remove curl progress informations, and the `| python -mjson.tool` to pretty-print
the result. You'll see you access various global statistics about your Riak CS cluster, great isn't it ? If
you need more "real-time" debugging Riak CS has some dtrace probes but I didn't try it myself. The full doc
is available [here](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Monitoring-and-Metrics/).

There's also a magic `usage` bucket which exposes usage statistics for each user, docs
[here](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Querying-Access-Statistics/) and in the following sections.


A conclusion
------------

I think that's enough as a first overview of Riak CS. Here are a few points I leave here as a conclusion:

1/ Riak CS leaves on top of Riak. So you can expect it to be reliable, easy to scale, and easy to
operate. And it has some monitoring goodies so day-to-day monitoring shouldn't be a problem.

2/ Riak CS is run by Basho. From my 2 short experiences in Basho's world, you can expect a truly
amazing support. Of course commercial support is recommended if you want extra features or some
guarantees, but that's not my case for now.

3/ The ecosystem is already here. For instance there's already a [redmine_s3](https://github.com/ka8725/redmine_s3)
plugin that just lacks proxy support to work with Riak CS. I bet I'll work on that in the next
few weeks so that I'll be able to store big files in my Redmine instance for free.

To sum it up, I can't wait to have the opportunity to dig into Riak CS a bit more! Stay tuned ;-)
