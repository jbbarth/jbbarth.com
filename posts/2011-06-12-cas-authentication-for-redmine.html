          <h1>CAS authentication for Redmine</h1>

<p>It’s been a while since I wanted to integrate <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> with my <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service"><span class="caps">CAS</span></a> server at $<span class="caps">WORK</span>. Unfortunately,
Redmine only supports its integrated login/password, <span class="caps">LDAP</span> auth and OpenID. There are existing demands on this topic (<a href=
"http://www.redmine.org/issues/2965">#2965 for instance</a>) but Redmine developers always refused to implement such specific authentications in the core
itself. I approve this choice, I think they should even drop OpenID, and maybe <span class="caps">LDAP</span> support (hard to maintain so many things, the
core should be leaner).</p>

<h2>Existing solutions</h2>

<p>I’m only aware of two existing solutions if you want to authenticate your Redmine users against <span class="caps">CAS</span> :</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2009/07/22/casify-redmine/">a blog post titled ‘CASify Redmine’</a> : it explains how to <em>modify</em> the
  core to use rubycas-client, definitely not a long-term solution</li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_cas">a plugin called redmine_cas</a> : it works, but it doesn’t exactly fit my needs :

    <ul>
      <li>it replaces Redmine standard authentication <em>completely</em> : I just want <span class="caps">CAS</span> authentication as a comfort option, as
      some of my users are not registered on the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server</li>

      <li>it cannot be configured in the interface : as a datacenter which offers a SaaS product for dozens of users, I want them to be able to configure the
      <span class="caps">CAS</span> server themselves (we have multiple addresses depending on wether your users are on the intranet, extranet or
      internet)</li>

      <li>there’s an annoying but when clicking on “logout” : <code>undefined method `destroy' for {}:Hash</code>, though it may be easy to fix</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, I also wanted to try to the OmniAuth authentication framework and see if it could help integrating Redmine with external authentication
sources (not only <span class="caps">CAS</span>).</p>

<h2>OmniAuth</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth">OmniAuth</a> (<a href=
"http://intridea.com/2010/10/4/omniauth-flexible-authentication-for-rack?blog=company">blog post</a>) is an awesome authentication framework built as a Rack
middleware.</p>

<p>It has a pretty simple workflow for external authentication sources. If we take the example of <span class="caps">CAS</span> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>call <code>/auth/cas</code> and you will be redirected to the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server (with the needed back url)</li>

  <li>after you logged in to your <span class="caps">CAS</span> server, you’re redirected to <code>/auth/cas/callback</code> and free to do whatever you want
  with the params returned, stored in <code>request.env["omniauth.auth"]</code> ; this hash stores at least the “provider” (“cas”) and the “uid”
  (“jeanbaptiste.barth” for instance)</li>
</ul>

<p>OmniAuth is covered in 3 railscasts, but the one that has been really helpful is <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth">#241 Simple
OmniAuth</a>.</p>

<h2>The “redmine_omniauth_cas” plugin</h2>

<p>I spent some hours last week-end to build the “redmine_omniauth_cas” plugin. The code is <a href="https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_omniauth_cas">on
github</a>. It relies on OmniAuth for (optionally) authenticating your users against a <span class="caps">CAS</span> server. The <span class=
"caps">CAS</span> server has to be configured in the plugin configuration section. It’s only compatible with Redmine 1.2.0 since latest versions of OmniAuth
are not compatible with Rack 1.0.1.</p>

<p>There are currently some limitations I plan to improve in the next versions :</p>

<ul>
  <li>implement ticket validation when first opening your browser (for now you’ll be considered as logged out if your session has expired on Redmine but your
  ticket is still valid on the <span class="caps">CAS</span> server)</li>

  <li>add a plugin option to hide ‘normal’ login/password form</li>

  <li>authorize on-the-fly registration</li>
</ul>

<p>I also plan to contribute to OmniAuth and especially the <span class="caps">CAS</span> provider. The current implementation is functional but not so
flexible, since it doesn’t support OmniAuth’s mechanisms to setup the <span class="caps">CAS</span> options at runtime.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This plugin is a first try at using OmniAuth with Redmine, but I could easily imagine building plugins to authenticate against other sources. I hope it
will be useful for some of you. I think it could even be a viable option to throw OpenID support out of the core, and let it live its life in a clean plugin.
Stay tuned !</p>
