          <h1>Trying MongoDB for Cartoque</h1>

<p>I recently open-sourced <a href="http://cartoque.org/">Cartoque</a>, the <span class="caps">CMDB</span> tool we use at $work. I want to make
it suitable for any medium-sized datacenter in the next few months, but with a bit more than 1 year of specific development for <em>my</em> platform, a
significant part of the app isn’t that generic and won’t fit other people needs. Moreover, most of this specific code is poorly tested or not tested at all,
because I knew from the beginning that I didn’t want to stick with it. I have to improve that.</p>

<h2>The problems with <span class="caps">SQL</span> and ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>Let’s say it from the beginning, ActiveRecord and <span class="caps">AREL</span> are <strong>fan-tas-tic</strong> tools. I really love them. But it turns
out they didn’t fit my needs really well this time.</p>

<p><strong>1- I need first-class citizen custom fields</strong> : in Cartoque, users should be able to define structured custom fields (with type,
constraints, optionally defining relations to other “tables”) ; these fields should be accessible with the <span class="caps">API</span> the same way normal
fields are (not with <code>cf.{custom_field_47}</code> (yes I’m looking at you Request Tracker). Redmine has a pretty robust solution for this, but the code
is far too complex for my little brain, and it doesn’t provide arbitrary relations to other tables.</p>

<p><strong>2- I need first-class citizen custom “tables”</strong> : you may have 2 SaaS products in your company. They each have different properties, hence
different custom fields. I need a mechanism for storing and retrieving different attributes for different object types. But maybe you have 3 products, and 2
of them have some common attributes. Same goes for some <span class="caps">DCI</span> patterns I’d like to implement (for instance switches, routers, servers
and virtual machines all have a processor). If you have some experience with <span class="caps">SQL</span> databases, you already imagine the nightmare it
would be to implement something in generic tables. Basically it consists in putting denormalized, unstructured data in a structured engine, just for the sake
of intellectual pleasure. Not a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>3- I don’t want to deal with secondary joins, callbacks to update a reference table, etc.</strong> : today in Cartoque I maintain a secondary
model called <code>ConfigurationItem</code>. Each CI has a configuration item, and common relations (such as contact relations) are linked to this model. It
means I need to update it with a complicated callback chain, and I add some extra joins everywhere as soon as I want to retrieve those informations. It will
become very complicated when I have to expose a dozen CIs in a single page. This is dirty and painful.</p>

<p><strong>4- I need double polymorphic associations, with constraints defined by the user</strong> : in a <span class="caps">CMDB</span>, nearly every CI
could be linked with every other CI. I didn’t find any good solution to provide this kind of link easily, and if possible let the user parameterize it.</p>

<p><strong>5 – <span class="caps">SQL</span> databases don’t know how to store complex objects</strong> : as I’m writing this, <span class="caps">SQL</span>
databases don’t support complex column types like <span class="caps">JSON</span>. They don’t know how to store Hash, nested Hashes, or Arrays. As soon as you
have complex objects to store, modelling them in relational databases becomes a problem, and leads to unnecesay pain.</p>

<h2>Enters MongoDB</h2>

<p>MongoDB has all this and more.</p>

<p>Kristóf Kovács wrote <a href="http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis">a fair comparison</a> of so-called “NoSQL” tools. Cartoque is
typically the kind of use-case he quotes as an example for MongoDB : <em>“For most things that you would do with MySQL or PostgreSQL, but having predefined
columns really holds you back.”</em> I also tried CouchDB (very complicated…), and Riak (which I really love but doesn’t fit this particular use case).</p>

<p>John Nunemaker also wrote <a href="http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/12/18/why-i-think-mongo-is-to-databases-what-rails-was-to-frameworks/">an
excellent article about ‘Why he thinks Mongo is to databases what Rails was to frameworks’</a>. It’s two years old, a bit old, but still relevant, and I
strongly encourage you to check it out. Back in these days MongoDB had some durability problems, and a very tiny ecosystem. But it has resolved its problems
and it has gained some popularity in the Rails community. Today there are tons of great gems for the basic functionalities I need in the application (for
instance friendly ids, pagination, trees, etc.).</p>

<p>So here I am, now : I’m trying MongoDB with the Mongoid <span class="caps">ORM</span> for 3 weeks now, and I’m very happy with it. I might write other
posts to cover more technical aspects later, but the best aspect so far is that it forced me to re-think the way I see my data in this application, it put me
a bit out of my <em>comfort zone</em> (e.g. <span class="caps">SQL</span> databases + ActiveRecord), and it opened a whole new world of great ideas for the
future of Cartoque.</p>

<p>Choose the right tool for the job. That’s all ;)</p>
